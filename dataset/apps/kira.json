  "description": "Kira is a next generation hyperscale decentralized exchange (DEX) engineered for cross-chain transfers and frictionless trading. On the one hand, Kira aims to deliver all the liquidity, performance and trading sophistication of a centralised exchange but without the custody, downtime and fraud risk that plague our industry. On the other hand, Kira offers stronger security guarantees than state-of-the-art DEXs, but with a powerful governance model that builds trust and engagement whilst actively resisting corruption.",
